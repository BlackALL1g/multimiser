Hi !
This is my program, so-called "multimiser". I'm going to fill up this thing during my developing in Golang.
Basically, it's sopposed to be educational stuff, where i will add more and more functionality while i'm growing up day by day.
There are some working applications like calculator, even or odd checker.
You can test it out by using "go run main.go" command in standard input.
